After implementing the verilog code.
We used the timing function to verify the working of the code.
Below, we are attaching the screenshots from the timing diagram

\subsection{ADD Operation}\label{subsec:add-operation}

information for the ADD operation and screenshots from quartus altera's timing diagram.

\subsection{SUB Operation}\label{subsec:sub-operation}

information for the SUB operation and screenshots from quartus altera's timing diagram.

\subsection{NAND Operation}\label{subsec:nand-operation}

information for the NAND operation and screenshots from quartus altera's timing diagram.

\subsection{XNOR Operation}\label{subsec:xnor-operation}

information for the XNOR operation and screenshots from quartus altera's timing diagram.

\subsection{Full working with reset operation}\label{subsec:full-working-with-reset-operation}

information for the all operation with reset functionality and screenshots from quartus altera's timing diagram.
