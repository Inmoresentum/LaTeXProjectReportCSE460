This report presents the design and implementation of a
4-bit ALU using Verilog HDL and Quartus II software.
The ALU was designed to perform various arithmetic
and logical operations such as \textbf{ADDITION}, \textbf{SUBTRACTION},
bitwise \textbf{AND}, bitwise \textbf{NAND}, and bitwise \textbf{XNOR}.
The design consists of various modules such as the Adder, Subtractor,
and logic gates which were generated based on the verilog code.
In this report, we provide a detailed description of the design and implementation process,
including the Verilog code for each module and the timing diagram for verification.
We also discuss the challenges encountered during the design process and how they were overcome.
Finally, we present the results of the hardware testing, demonstrating that
the ALU is capable of performing the desired operations accurately and efficiently.
The design of a 4-bit ALU is an essential component in digital circuit design,
and it is a fundamental building block in many larger circuits and VLSI design.
