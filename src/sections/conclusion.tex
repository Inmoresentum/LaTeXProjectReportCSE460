In conclusion, we have successfully designed and implemented a 4-bit ALU using finite state machines and \textit{Verilog HDL}.
We started by defining the project requirements and selecting the appropriate operations to be implemented.
Then, we designed the FSM with four states and carefully defined the transitions and outputs for each state.
We also implemented the FSM using Verilog HDL and simulated the design using timing diagram to verify its functionality.
The simulation results show that our design works correctly for all the selected operations and input combinations.
Finally, this project not only provided hands-on experience with Verilog HDL programming and digital circuit design, but also reinforced the
importance of a systematic approach to problem-solving and the importance of utilizing efficient design strategies.
